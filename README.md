This script is a Python program that connects to a Telegram account using the python-telegram-bot library. The script creates a bot and listens for status messages in the chat. When a specific user (specified by their username) comes online, the bot sends a message to the chat notifying that the user is now online.

The script uses the telepot.aio library, which provides asynchronous implementation of the telepot library, to handle the communication with the Telegram bot API. The script sets up a DelegatorBot that delegates the handling of messages to a NotifyOnAction class, which inherits from the telepot.aio.helper.ChatHandler class. The NotifyOnAction class listens for chat messages and checks if the message is a status message and if the username of the user who came online matches the target user. If both conditions are met, the class sends a message to the chat.

Finally, the script starts an event loop to listen for messages and runs the loop forever, so the bot continues to listen for status messages even after a message has been sent.


<b> <h4> usage </h4> </b> <br>
Replace YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_API_KEY with your actual Telegram bot API key, YOUR_CHAT_ID with the chat ID of your account, and TARGET_USER_NAME with the username of the person you want to track.

This script listens for status messages in the chat and sends you a message when the specified user comes online.

Note: To use this script, you will need to have Python installed on your computer, as well as the telepot and asyncio libraries. You can install these libraries using pip.
